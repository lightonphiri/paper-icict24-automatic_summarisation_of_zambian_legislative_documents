# Accessible Legislative Information: Automatic Summarisation of Zambian Legislative Documents

## Introduction
The National Assembly of Zambia is mandated by law to “To execute the legislative, oversight, representative and budgetary functions for enhanced democratic governance” [1]. In the 2022-2026 strategic plan [2], the “Strategic Objective 2.2” aims to “Enhance Public Perceptions of the National Assembly” by making parliament open and accessible to the public and, additionally strengthening ICT platforms for public engagement.

While parliament, and entities such as the Zambia Legal Information Institute (ZambiaLII) [3], publicly makes available important legislation, interpretation of the documents is problematic due to the size of the documents and the vocabulary used. Masson and Tahir report that the barriers associated with providing open and accessible legal information relies on two factors: ease of access and the capacity to interpret the documents [4].

## Proposed Solution
A potential solution to the problem of interpreting legal documents could involve the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically summarise the legislative documents. Existing literature broadly categorise automatic summarisation into two classes: abstractive summarisation and extractive summarisation [5].

This paper presents a study aimed at examining the barriers individuals face when attempting to comprehend legislative documents, specifically acts of parliament. In addition, the study was aimed at devising and assessing the feasibility of implementing an NLP model capable of generating concise summaries of these extensive documents.

## Methodology
In order to understand challenges faced when comprehending legal documents, 150 undergraduate students were sampled from the University of Zambia using random sampling. To determine the feasibility of using NLP techniques to provide concise summaries of legislative documents, two (2) NLP models—an abstractive summarisation model and extractive summarisation model. A human evaluation strategy was used to perform a comparative evaluation of the two (2) NLP models, in order to determine the more effective approach.

## Results and Discussion
A significant portion—approximately 74.29%—of participants reported 'Never' (33.99%) or 'Rarely' (40.3%) engaging with legislative documents. In contrast, (25.71%) indicated frequent or very frequent interaction. This distribution underscores a significant gap in familiarity and engagement with Zambian legislative materials among the study participants. In assessing participants' overall understanding of legal documents, the majority (43.5%) expressed a neutral perception, suggesting that they found these documents neither easy nor hard to understand.


The majority of the human evaluators had a preference for the abstractive summarisation model, indicating that its brevity, simplicity, and directness as reasons for their choice. In addition, the results of the abstractive summarisation model were stated as being easier to understand.
